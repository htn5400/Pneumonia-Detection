# Pneumonia-Detection
**Diagnosing Pneumonia through a Web App: A Computer Vision project applying AI/ML principles to detect disease in X-ray images**

Pneumonia is the #1 most common reason for US children to be hospitalized. For US adults, pneumonia is the most common cause of hospital admissions other than women giving birth. About 1 million adults in the US seek care in a hospital due to pneumonia every year, and 50,000 die from this disease.

This project will use the publicly available ChestX-Ray8 pneumonia x-ray image dataset available from the Harvard website.

**Module I: Explore the x-ray dataset, use image manipulation techniques, iterate baseline AI models**

1. Differentiate the classes found in our dataset

2. Build baseline machine learning models to diagnose pneumonia
- Using logistic regression
- Using decision trees
- Using K-nearest neighbors

**Module II: Build and evaluate neural networks + transfer learning with optimization techniques**
1. Use Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning techniques
2. Learn about hyperparameter tuning using parameter grid searches 
3. Calculate model performance using various metrics

**Module III: Evaluate on field data and improve with data augmentation**
1. Learn to manipulate images with OpenCV
2. Implement data augmentation
3. Evaluate model performance on field data

**Module IV: Deploy model to the web as hosted by Streamlit**
1. Use Streamlit to construct a web application
2. Integrate TensorflowJS to perform model inference
3. Use HTML with CSS libraries to design our front-end

**(IN PROGRESS) Module V:**
1. Use unsupervised machine learning techniques to explore our dataset
- Use Principal Component Analysis, K means clustering, and hierarchical clustering
- Create data visualizations
3. Learn to perform feature extraction using OpenCV
4. Perform image segmentation using Keras
